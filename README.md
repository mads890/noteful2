This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This ReactApp allows the user to create notes and organize them in folders. 
Notes can also be deleted.

This project uses fetch with a GET request to acquire data from the noteful api 
and a DELETE request to delete notes.
